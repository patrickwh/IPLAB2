Mixed Crostini#1#mixed_crostini.jpg
You can mix and match these four types of crostini - cherry tomato, roasted pepper, crab and egg - to taste. A 35cm-long baguette yields about 25 slices and each topping is enough for 16 crostini, so these recipes will make enough for 64 canapés - perfect for a small drinks party. To serve all four as hearty nibbles before a small dinner party, halve the quantities so you make 32 canapés. The better the quality of your bread, the more delicious your crostini, but you can also serve these toppings on savoury biscuits or pastry bases.
